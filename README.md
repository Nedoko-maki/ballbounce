# ballbounce
This was a school-related project that dealt with a 2D gravity simulation with a particle of significant volume and area. 

Things that could be improved is the fundamental understanding I had of how to model physics iteratively.
May release an improved version sometime in the future to demonstate the changes of my programming style.
